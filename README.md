# MedAccess
Graduation project focused on developing a decentralized application using Web3.js, IPFS, Metamak, (IPFS), jQuery, Bootstrap, NodeJS, MongoDB and webpack. The project utlized an off-chain solution (IPFS) to reduce medical record and store the actual content of each medical record stored on the blockchain using IPFS-HTTP-CLIENT NodeJS library via smart contracts. Each record instance is created/attached by physicians or lab-technician, then signed via metamask. Consequently, the record is encrypted using the symmetric AES-256-bit encryption handled in NodeJs backend using the crypto.js library. Moreover, a public-key RSA cryptography would then be applied to govern an asymmetric key encryption. Hence, facilitators e.g. physician, lab technicians of the system would be able to view the medical record only if patients with possessed private can grant or remove access from desired facilitators. The project was developed in a local blockchain enviroment using Ganache and truffle.
